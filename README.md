# Planetary Devastation
## Background
You start off as a tiny black hole in Outer Space. The goal is to get bigger and bigger by consuming other planets. You cannot consume objects that have more mass than you do. At certain intervals, bosses spawn in and the goal is to get big enough to consume the boss before the boss spawns in. 

## Functionality
In Planetary Devastation, users will be able to:
* Make the black hole follow the cursor
* Feed other planets to the black hole
* Listen to the soundtrack of the game while playing
* Look at different kinds of planetary bodies
