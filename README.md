# Planetary Devastation
## Background
You start off as a tiny black hole in Outer Space. The goal is to get bigger and bigger by consuming planetary objects such as asteroids and other planets. You cannot consume objects that have more mass than you do. The momentum and gravity aspects are also taken into consideration when animating the absorption process. At a certain point of time, the entire Solar System spawns in. The goal is to get big enough to consume the Sun. All the planetary bodies follow gravitational laws and orbits.

## Functionality
In Planetary Devastation, users will be able to:
* Move the black hole around to feed it asteroids and planets
* Visually see the absorption/collision process of the black hole and the asteroid/planet
* See the gravitational pull of planetary bodies affect your player model
* Be able to look at the structured orbits of certain clusters of planets like the Solar System
* Listen to background music along with a mute button
* Look at various planetary bodies and clusters of planets

## Technologies Used
* For the core game logic - DOM Manipulation using Vanilla JavaScript
* For the rendering - HTML, CSS and the Canvas API
* For collisions, gravity and orbits - applied physics and mathematics

## Implementation Timeline
* Friday (W9D5) - Research on the physics aspect of the project
* Weekend - Implementing the smaller components (black hole, asteroid, planet classes)
* Monday (W10D1) - Implementing core game logic with Canvas API
* Tuesday (W10D2) - Implementing core game logic with Canvas API / CSS
* Wednesday (W10D3) - Finish up CSS
